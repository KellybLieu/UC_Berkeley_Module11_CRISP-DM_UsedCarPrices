# UC_Berkeley_Module11_CRISP-DM_UsedCarPrices
 Module 11 introduces CRISP-DM as framework for a data mining data science capstone project. This assignment requires exploring an external dataset, which contains information on 426K cars. The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive, using several machine learning models and techniques, such as multiple regression. The results will be delivered to the primary clientele, whom are used car dealers. The deliverable is a basic report with details of primary findings and recommendations for what consumers value in a used car.
